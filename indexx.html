                    <h3>1. Whistler Blackcomb - Whistler, British Columbia, Canada</h3>
                    <img src="./canada snow1.webp" alt="">
                    <p>Whistler Blackcomb is often ranked among the best ski resorts in the world, but that doesn’t mean
                        non-skiers will be left twiddling their thumbs either. The resort’s village has so much to do,
                        it almost feels like a big city that’s been dropped right into the mountains. There are
                        practically endless shopping opportunities as well as outstanding restaurants and plenty of fun
                        activities too. The park has its own cinema, an outdoor skating rink, and a tube park. You can
                        hop on a snowmobile and take a tour of the breathtaking winter wonderland, be entertained by
                        performers with their electric mix of music, dance, and spinning fire, or experience a
                        high-flying adventure with the network of zip-lines and suspension bridges at Ziptrek. One thing
                        that’s a definite must-do for enjoying some of the most epic views on the planet is to take a
                        ride on the Peak 2 Peak Gondola.</p>

                    <h4>2. Park City Mountain Resort & Montage Deer Valley - Park City, Utah</h4>
                    <img src="park city snow2.webp" alt="">
                    <p>You definitely don’t have to ski or board to enjoy Park City – in fact, you can still ride down
                        the mountain too thanks to the Alpine Coaster. The elevated track winds through over a mile of
                        loops and curves at speeds of up to 30 miles per hour. It’s just like a roller coaster, but
                        you’ll get to enjoy the gorgeous, snowy mountain scenery of Park City. There are many other fun
                        non-skiing options too, like the Flying Eagle zipline that will allow you to soar above the
                        trees while propelled 110 feet over the resort’s ski runs at speeds of up to 45 miles per hour.
                        For more tame activities, try cozying up on an old-fashioned horse-drawn sleigh or take a Viking
                        Yurt adventure – a snowcat-pulled sleigh ride that will bring you up to your very own yurt
                        nestled among a nighttime winter wonderland. <br>

                        At Montage Deer Valley, you can experience the thrill of snow tubing at Powder Park or test your
                        bowling skills at the resort’s four-lane regulation bowling alley. After a long day of play,
                        head to Spa Montage to indulge in some relaxation in its redwood saunas and copper-soaking tubs.

                    <img src="switerland snow3.webp" alt="">
                    <p>Another fantastic Switzerland resort for non-skiers, Zermatt is not as pricey or flashy as St.
                        Moritz, but it’s just as fun. Its streets are car-free for a more peaceful atmosphere and are
                        lined with many upscale nightclubs and shops, while the larger-than-life Matterhorn looms in the
                        background. During the day, non-ski options include shopping the many chic boutiques, tandem
                        paragliding, hiking, and snowshoeing. There are also lots of great options for sledding – the
                        toboggan run on the Gornergrat is known as one of the finest in the Alps. The thrilling
                        10-minute run includes the mountain panorama with the Matterhorn. There is also ice climbing,
                        ice skating, ice hockey, and mountain excursions. When you’re done, be sure to stop in for
                        mulled red wine at Igloo Bar, made almost entirely out of ice.</p>

                    <h6>4. Stowe Mountain Resort - Stowe, Vermont
                    </h6>
                    <img src="./vermont snow4.webp" alt="">
                    <p>A popular escape for east-coast dwellers, Stowe is a rustic compound that excels at catering to
                        everyone’s idea of the perfect winter vacation. Experience being on a sled pulled by Alaskan
                        huskies with a sledding excursion or hop aboard one of Gentle Giants’ sleigh rides driven by
                        gentle Percheron and Belgian draft horses with beautifully lit Santa-style sleighs gliding among
                        the breathtaking New England scenery. You can head across covered bridges, along winding brooks,
                        and through the snowy forest. You’ll also be treated to views of Vermont’s highest peak, Mt.
                        Mansfield along the way. The very best views and cuisine in the region can be found at the Cliff
                        House Restaurant, which sits atop Mt. Mansfield. Don’t miss taking a stroll through charming
                        downtown Stowe either, with its preserved historic structures and fun attractions, like tours of
                        Ben & Jerry’s ice cream factory.</p><hr>

                    <h3>5. Mont Tremblant - Quebec, Canada
                    </h3>
                    <img src="mont canada snow5.webp" alt="">
                    <p>Beautiful Mont Tremblant is situated 80 miles north of Montreal and is frequently named the top
                        resort in eastern North America. While skiers appreciate its wide runs that are occasionally
                        dotted with moguls, it’s the town that earns honors as much as the mountain itself. Not only
                        does this walkable village offer a rich array of international eateries and one of the most
                        vibrant après-ski scenes in the region, but visitors will also have access to all sorts of
                        activities like ice climbing, snowmobiling, dog sledding, and more. In fact, there is so much to
                        do here that you’ll probably run out of time way before you run out of ways to spend it.</p><hr>
